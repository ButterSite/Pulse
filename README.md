## Tech Stack

### Backend

- **Node.js** (ES Modules)
- **Express** – Main HTTP server and routing
- **JWT (jsonwebtoken)** – Secure token-based authentication
- **bcrypt** – Password hashing and verification
- **dotenv** – Environment variable management
- **CORS** – Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- **MongoDB** (with **Mongoose**) – NoSQL database support
- **PostgreSQL** (with **Sequelize** ORM) – SQL database support
- **Sequelize CLI** – Database migrations and management
- **TypeScript** – Type safety (with full type definitions for all major libraries)

#### Dev Dependencies

- `@types/*` packages for full TypeScript support
- **typescript** – TypeScript compiler

### Frontend

> **Directory structure and dependencies for the frontend are not fully available from the current context.**
> However, the project is primarily written in JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS, indicating a modern web development stack.
